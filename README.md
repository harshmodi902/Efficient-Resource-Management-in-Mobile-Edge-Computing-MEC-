This is a group research project consisting of four peoples among which I was one of them.
This was an RL-based project for resource management in Mobile Edge Computing.
I combined TRPO and SAC to address exploration inefficiency and instability.
The hybrid model resulted in:
15% lower latency
12% better cache hit rate
Better computational efficiency than pure SAC
It strengthened my understanding of reinforcement learning, optimization, and simulator-based evaluations.
